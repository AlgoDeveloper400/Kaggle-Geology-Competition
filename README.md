# Kaggle-Geology-Competition
Contains source code used in the geology competition from kaggle.
In the notebook, replace "Your file path to the data file..." with the file path to you data files such as the train.csv and test.csv files from the competition. The data file you can get from the competition itself, due to privacy and competition rules I cannot share the data files here.

For your information, majority of the code you see here was generated by AI, I simply had to debug and ensure that it was error free. And yes some level of background ML and Python knowledge is needed to do this successfully.
